Who’s Diss?
A quiz game with multiple categories of famous disses and beefs between: Rappers/MCs, Celebrities, and Authors. The final outcome of the game will result in a score out of 10 questions. In addition, available links to play music are present at each page. Personalization of the final outcome by using the player’s name is available.

Project status
The game plays as planned. My stretch goal is to have audio clips play based on the success-level of play: “cheers” for a high-score, or “jeers” for low-score.
